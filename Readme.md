Decentralized Competitive Coding Platform

### Project Description
This project is a Solidity smart contract that enables the creation and management of coding challenges in a decentralized and trustless manner. Participants pay an entry fee to enter a challenge, contributing to the prize pool, with the winner receiving the entire pool. The contract ensures fair competition and transparent prize distribution.

### Project Vision
The vision of this project is to foster a decentralized competitive coding environment where developers can create and participate in coding challenges with fair reward distribution. It aims to enhance the integrity and transparency of coding competitions by leveraging blockchain technology.

### Key Features
1. **Challenge Creation**:
   - Owners can create new coding challenges by specifying a name and entry fee.
   - Challenges are activated once created and participants can enter by paying the entry fee.

2. **Participation**:
   - Users can participate by sending the exact entry fee.
   - The fee contributes to the prize pool, ensuring participants are financially committed.

3. **Winner Declaration**:
   - The challenge owner can declare a winner.
   - The winner receives the entire prize pool.
   - Once declared, the challenge becomes inactive.

4. **Transparency & Trustlessness**:
   - All challenge participants and the prize pool are stored on the blockchain.
   - No centralized authority interferes in determining the winner or managing the funds.

5. **Event Logging**:
   - Events are emitted for challenge creation, participation, and winner declaration for tracking and audit purposes.

6. ## Future Improvements 
   ** Entry fee refunds for non-winners. ** 
   **Random winner selection for fairness.  **
   ** Multi-chain deployment for accessibility. ** 
   ** Leaderboards and stats for engagement.  **
   ** Gas optimizations for cost reduction.**
